# Chess-Game
ChessLab is a Java-based console application that provides a basic architecture for simulating chess games, managing players, recording matches, and organizing simple tournaments. The project is structured into multiple classes to keep components modular — enabling future expansion into areas such as move validation, strategy evaluation, and game persistence.
